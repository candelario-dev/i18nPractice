# Practice with React-Intl
> This is a simple project to try out react-intl. It was made by cloning coding-with-chaim i18n-starter-files Github repository (found at: https://github.com/coding-with-chaim/i18n-starter-files) and by following his step-by-step youtube tutorial (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrWRxs-lqj4).
> The layout is very similar to the default create-reacyt-app layout and style, but with an added drop-down menu where the user can change the language the information will appear in.


The main idea of the project is to explore react-intl's abilities and to see how this can be beneficial for future applications where the language can be changed.
